<code>preventScrollBugsIfNeeded()</code> does two things:
* Fix that annoying scroll bug ios has had for many years;
* Prevent pull to refresh whan needed;

Look at index.ts.

<a name="preventScrollBugsIfNeeded
This fixes an annoying iOS15+ behavior on apple devices.
Prevents pull down to refresh if the element you are pulling down has a scroll.
I used a css class scrollable to identify the dom elements who needs to prevent pull to refresh.
You can do it by using getComputedStyle(target).overflow === auto|scroll, but its more demanding in terms of performance."></a>
